# Audience Optimization

## Exclusion Strategy
| Audience Type | Implementation | Expected Impact |
|---------------|----------------|------------------|
| Current Customers | Create custom audience of past 90-day purchasers and exclude from acquisition campaigns | Reduce wasted spend, lower CAC by 15-20% |
| Cart Abandoners | Move to dedicated remarketing campaigns with specific messaging | Increase conversion rate by 20-30% |
| Ad Engagers (No Action) | Create 30-day audience of users who engaged but took no action | Avoid audience saturation, improve auction efficiency |

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create custom audience segments in TikTok/Snapchat
2. Add exclusions to all prospecting campaigns
3. Create dedicated remarketing campaigns
4. Monitor frequency scores weekly

## Audience Bundling
| Platform | Implementation | Expected Impact |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| TikTok | Bundle similar interests into broader groups to increase delivery potential | Improve algorithm learning, reduce CAC by 10-15% |
| Snapchat | Use Snap Lifestyle Categories instead of specific interests | Expand reach while maintaining relevance |

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Identify top-performing interests
2. Create 3-5 broader interest bundles
3. Test against individual interests
4. Scale winners after 7-day test period
